:: Oliver Valentine: Conversation #1[START]
Why, hello there, darling. Don’t you look simply…. Ethereal this evening. I saw you from across the room and have been dying to speak to you. 
[[Thank you. I was dying to speak to you as well. ]]  
[[You are quite dashing yourself.]]
[[What the hell is that supposed to mean?]]

:: Candlelight dinner, fine red wine, maybe some relaxing piano music, and end it was a moonlight walk.[[END]]
Ahhh, a person of good taste. That sounds simply to die for. I hope we can meet again later. 
[[x]]

:: I just don’t accept compliments from weird creeps.
*Gasps* How dare you insult me! Leave me at once! 

:: I was looking for love, but it’s not looking promising….
Hmmpf, what is that supposed to mean? You aren’t impressed with Lord Oliver??
[[Not really….]]
[[No, it’s not that! I swear! You’re just not really my type.]]
[[I’m sorry, we got off on the wrong foot. Let’s try that again.]]

:: I’m just looking for someone to have a good time with. See what happens.
Hmm, fascinating. Well, what would be your ideal “good time”?
[[Long walk through the cemetery, maybe have a nice picnic under the moonlight.]]
[[Candlelight dinner, fine red wine, maybe some relaxing piano music, and end it was a moonlight walk.]]
[[Probably just playing video games and ordering pizzas.]]

:: I’m looking for love.\
Love you say? So you’re a romantic? What would be your ideal date? 
[[Long walk through the cemetery, maybe have a nice picnic under the moonlight.]]
[[Candlelight dinner, fine red wine, maybe some relaxing piano music, and end it was a moonlight walk.]]
[[Probably just playing video games and ordering pizzas.]]

:: I’m sorry, we got off on the wrong foot. Let’s try that again.
I’ll give you one more chance. Tell me, what would be your ideal date?
[[Long walk through the cemetery, maybe have a nice picnic under the moonlight.]]
[[Candlelight dinner, fine red wine, maybe some relaxing piano music, and end it was a moonlight walk.]]
[[Probably just playing video games and ordering pizzas.]]

:: Long walk through the cemetery, maybe have a nice picnic under the moonlight.[[END]]
That does sound lovely. Though perhaps a bit boring. Being surrounded by the dead can be a bit dry as bone. Perhaps we will speak again. 
[[x]]

:: No, it’s not that! I swear! You’re just not really my type.[[END]]
I am everyone’s type. But I suppose not everyone has taste. 
[[x]]

:: Not really….[[END]]
Well, good luck finding love! You will clearly need it! 
[[x]]

:: Probably just playing video games and ordering pizzas.[[END]]
Ugh… perhaps I was wrong about you. Maybe we do not have a connection. 
[[x]]

:: Thank you. I was dying to speak to you as well.\
Now, what is a creature like you doing in a place like this?
[[I’m looking for love. ]]
[[I’m just looking for someone to have a good time with. See what happens.]] 
[[I was looking for love, but it’s not looking promising….]]

:: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Well, I meant it as a compliment, but I can see you are perhaps not capable of understanding such things. 
[[I’m sorry, we got off on the wrong foot. Let’s try that again.]]
[[I just don’t accept compliments from weird creeps.]]

:: You are quite dashing yourself.
*Blushes* I’m beginning to like you already. Now, what is a creature like you doing in a place like this? 
[[I’m looking for love. ]]
[[I’m just looking for someone to have a good time with. See what happens.]]
[[I was looking for love, but it’s not looking promising….]]
